Users will be able to participate in a game of \u201cGo Fish\u201d with their peers while having Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) available to them. Each user will take turns until the game is complete and one of the users has won. The game can be played between multiple devices, as long as each user has access to a web browser. An interactive AAC interface will meet users' communication needs by offering commonly used Go Fish phrases, as well as further options for individualized customization. The game will show the AAC communication while it is in progress as this visual cue is important for empathy building among users. The goal of this project is to provide a seamless and interactive experience for children regardless of their ability to communicate verbally."}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(t.h2,{id:"conceptual-design",children:"Conceptual Design"}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(t.p,{children:"The game will be played on two to four separate devices.
