# Unit tests
## Backend Testing Report

We are using `pytest` for the backend. Used for its cleaner assertion syntax and organization. Overall easier to use compared to others like unittest due to the decreased boilerplate code needed. This library makes it easy to add to and expand our testing.

Our unit tests for the backend comprehensively test game state, game actions, lobby creation, and role swapping.
