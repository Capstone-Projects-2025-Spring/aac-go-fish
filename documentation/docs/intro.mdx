# Introduction

**Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC)** devices are tools that support individuals with speech and communication disabilities, enabling them to express themselves through nonverbal or assisted means. These devices range from digital picture boards to speech-generating devices. For many AAC users, especially those with autism or related communication differences, digital tools are central to daily communication, learning, and play.

This project introduces a web-based game that places the **AAC users as primary drivers of gameplay**. Unlike traditional designs where games are made *for* AAC users, this system enables AAC users to *control and drive* the game through their devices. This facilitates a social and communicative experience that empowers users.

The design is guided by the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) and the autism-specific [AASPIRE Web Accessibility Guidelines](https://doi.org/10.1089/aut.2018.0020), which emphasize:

- **Intellectual accessibility** (clear structure and language)
- **Social accessibility** (predictable interaction and reduced ambiguity)

These design principles inform everything in the application with the goal of building a platform that is both accessible and engaging from the start, not as an afterthought.

The system serves as both a **collaborative play environment** and a **research platform** for understanding how AAC interfaces can support autonomy, communication, and engagement through in game interaction.
